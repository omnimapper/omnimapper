In order to install omnimapper, you must have a valid C++ build environment with
CMake (> 3.12) and a Python 3 (> 3.7) installation. A Blender installation is
also a requirement, but if you are installing this add-on you probably already
know as much.

To perform a default installation, run

$ cmake -Bbuild && cd build && make install

This should install the add-on in the appropriate directory for Blender user
add-ons and it should be ready to use once you restart Blender. 

If you want to install the add-on to another location, simply pass
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your desired installation path> to cmake as a command
line argument.

If you are a developer, we recommend passing -DDEV=1 to cmake. This will create
timestamped shared libraries so that you don't have to restart Blender every
time you want to test out a new build of the add-on. For this, you must also
pass OMNIMAPPER_DEV=1 as an enviroment variable to Blender upon startup. Running

$ make install

within your build directory will build and install the modified add-on to your
previously specified installation path.
